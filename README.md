# MonoGame.XamarinForms

Currently this project is in the early stages.  Android and iOS implementations are functional for the most part, but not well tested or debugged

In order to use this project, you will need to clone the repo and build from source.

After building add a reference to the built dlls for your platform.  For shared libraries, use the normal PCL nuget package. 

You will then need to create a control and a renderers for the GameView.
